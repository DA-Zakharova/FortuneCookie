ğŸ¥  Fortune Cookie

This is a small interactive project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When you click on the cookie, a random positive message appears â€” just like a real fortune cookie âœ¨

ğŸ“Œ Why I made this project
I created it as a gift for my Spanish teacher. Iâ€™m currently learning Spanish and truly love the language, so I wanted to combine my coding skills with my passion for it ğŸ’›

ğŸ“š What I used
 â€¢ HTML & CSS for structure and styling
 â€¢ JavaScript for generating random messages

This is a purely educational project, made with love and a bit of fun ğŸ˜Š
